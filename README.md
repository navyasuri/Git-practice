#### Short summary
This Medium article by Josh Wulf discusses the impact of the open source concept on software developing and developers, concentraiting mostly on the abrupt shifts it is causing in the requruitment world. 

#### Thoughts
Althought the impact of GitHub on software developing is rather straightforwards, I found the idea of **Github as an equalizer** rather intriguing - this is the way he calls GitHub in the light of its ability to open a pathway to jobs and opportunities for people who would have otherwise been denied the access simply based on lack of privilege. On the other hand, the author's belief on everything eventually shifitng to a open-source format to the extent where people would not need CVs nor networks and connections since everything would be readily available on Google to search, seems slightly too naive.

> #### Nav's comments:
> I enjoyed the article about how Github acts as a social network - this is infact becoming increasingly common. I feel that it will take longer than 2 years for it to replace CVs and the like since most developers and companies today still do not manage their issue tracking and bug reporting on GitHub itself. Further, it is not easy for a lot of developers or engineers to understand complex open source frameworks and make changes to them (my opinion), and hence most don't do it. This does not equate to them being poor developers! Whatever the future holds, for now we can aim at getting those colored GitHub squares and having that satisfaction that we are contributing (even if only to our own projects).
